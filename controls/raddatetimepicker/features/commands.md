# Commands

This article provides an information about the following commands that __RadDateTimePicker__ exposes through  the __RadDateTimePickerCommands__ static class:

* `SetToday` Command

* `Close` Command

## SetToday Command

Using the __SetToday__ command the current date of __RadDateTimePicker__ could be set to the current date (today).

In __Example 1__ a __Button__ is linked to the __RadDateTimePickerCommands.SetToday__ command after whose execution the date will be set to the current day:

__Example 1: SetToday command__

```XAML
	<telerik:RadDateTimePicker x:Name="dateTimePicker1" />
	<telerik:RadButton Command="{x:Static telerik:RadDateTimePickerCommands.SetToday}" 
					   CommandTarget="{Binding ElementName=dateTimePicker1}" 
					   Content="Set Today"/>
```

## Close Command

The __Close__ command closes the drop down part of __RadDateTimePicker__ if it is opened.

The following example shows how to close the drop down of __RadDateTimePicker__ by executing the __Close__ command:

```C#
	RadDateTimePickerCommands.Close.Execute(null, this.dateTimePicker1);
```
