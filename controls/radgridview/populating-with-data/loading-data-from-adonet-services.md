# Loading Data from ADO.NET Services

The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to populate a __RadGridView__ with data from an __ADO.NET Data Service__ in two ways:

* A straight-forward way - [plain method calls](#Plain_Method_Calls). 

* Using MVVM approach.  

>This tutorial will use the __Northwind__ database, which can be downloaded from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=06616212-0356-46A0-8DA2-EEBC53A68034&displaylang=en).

Before proceeding further with this tutorial you need to create a new application and add a __RadGridView__ declaration in your XAML: 



```XAML
	<telerik:RadGridView x:Name="radGridView"/>
```

## Plain Method Calls

* Add a reference to your ADO.NET Data Service. 

* Switch to the code-behind and add a reference to the __NorthwindEntities__ object.



```C#
	NorthwindEntities dbContext = new NorthwindEntities(new Uri("GridViewDataService.svc", UriKind.Relative));
```



```C#
	NorthwindEntities dbContext2 = new NorthwindEntities(new Uri("Enter your service address here"));
```
```VB.NET
	Private dbContext As New NorthwindEntities(New Uri("GridViewDataService.svc", UriKind.Relative))
```

```VB.NET
	Private dbContext2 As New NorthwindEntities(New Uri("Enter your service address here"))
```

>tipFor more information about how to add a reference to an ADO.NET Data Service and how to create a new instance of the exposed entity, take a look at the

Add the following code which will make the initial load of the objects. 



```C#
	private void BeginRequest()
	{
	    DataServiceQuery<Customer> query = dbContext.CreateQuery<Customer>("Customers");
	    query.BeginExecute(RequestCompleted, query);
	}
	
	private void RequestCompleted(IAsyncResult asyncResult)
	{
	    DataServiceQuery<Customer> query = asyncResult.AsyncState as DataServiceQuery<Customer>;
	    var customers = query.EndExecute(asyncResult).ToList();
	    this.radGridView.ItemsSource = customers;
	}
```
```VB.NET
	Private Sub BeginRequest()
	    Dim query As DataServiceQuery(Of Customer) = dbContext.CreateQuery(Of Customer)("Customers")
	    query.BeginExecute(AddressOf RequestCompleted, query)
	End Sub
	
	Private Sub RequestCompleted(ByVal asyncResult As IAsyncResult)
	    Dim query As DataServiceQuery(Of Customer) = TryCast(asyncResult.AsyncState, DataServiceQuery(Of Customer))
	    Dim customers = query.EndExecute(asyncResult).ToList()
	    Me.radGridView.ItemsSource = customers
	End Sub
```



```C#
	this.radGridView.ItemsSource = dbContext.Customers.Execute().ToList();
```
```VB.NET
	Me.radGridView.ItemsSource = dbContext.Customers.Execute().ToList()
	'
```

Run your demo, the result can be seen on the next image:

## Using MVVM Approach

This section will show you how to populate your __RadGridView__ control in a MVVM manner. __RadGridView__ will be bound to a data source object, that has a property __Customers__. When the control is loaded all customers from the Customers table in the Northwind database are loaded{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %} asynchronously{% endif %}.

* Create a new class named __NorthwindDataSource__. 



```C#
	public class NorthwindDataSource
	{
	}
```
```VB.NET
	Public Class NorthwindDataSource
	End Class
```

* Add a reference to your ADO.NET Data Service. 

* In the __NorthwindDataSource__ class add a reference to an __ObservableCollection__ of __Customers__. 

* In the __NorthwindDataSource__ class add a reference to the __NorthwindEntities__ object: 



```C#
	public class NorthwindDataSource
	{
	    private static NorthwindEntities northwindEntity;
	    public NorthwindDataSource()
	    {
	        northwindEntity = new NorthwindEntities(new Uri("GridViewDataService.svc", UriKind.Relative));
	        this.Customers = new ObservableCollection<Customer>();
	    }
	    public ObservableCollection<Customer> Customers
	    {
	        get;
	        set;
	    }
	}
```
```VB.NET
	Public Class NorthwindDataSource
	    Private Shared northwindEntity As NorthwindEntities
	    Public Sub New()
	        northwindEntity = New NorthwindEntities(New Uri("GridViewDataService.svc", UriKind.Relative))
	        Me.Customers = New ObservableCollection(Of Customer)()
	    End Sub
	    Public Property Customers() As ObservableCollection(Of Customer)
	End Class
```



```C#
	public class NorthwindDataSource
	{
	    private static NorthwindEntities northwindEntity;
	    public NorthwindDataSource()
	    {
	        northwindEntity = new NorthwindEntities(new Uri("Enter your service address here"));
	        this.Customers = new ObservableCollection<Customer>();
	    }
	    public ObservableCollection<Customer> Customers
	    {
	        get;
	        set;
	    }
	}
```
```VB.NET
	Public Class NorthwindDataSource
	    Private Shared northwindEntity As NorthwindEntities
	    Public Sub New()
	        northwindEntity = New NorthwindEntities(New Uri("Enter your service address here"))
	        Me.Customers = New ObservableCollection(Of Customer)()
	    End Sub
	    Public Property Customers() As ObservableCollection(Of Customer)
	End Class
```

* Add the following code in the constructor of the __NorthwindDataSource__. It will make the initial load of all __Customers__ from the database: 



```C#
	northwindEntity.Customers.BeginExecute(
	    (IAsyncResult result) => EntitiesLoaded<Customer>(result, this.Customers),
	    northwindEntity.Customers);
```



```C#
	foreach (Customer c in northwindEntity.Customers.Execute())
	{
	    this.Customers.Add(c);
	}
```
```VB.NET
	northwindEntity.Customers.BeginExecute(Function(result As IAsyncResult) EntitiesLoaded(Of Customer)(result, Me.Customers), northwindEntity.Customers)
```

```VB.NET
	For Each c As Customer In northwindEntity.Customers.Execute()
	    Me.Customers.Add(c)
	Next c
```

{% if site.site_name == 'Silverlight' %}

And here is the code for the __EntitiesLoaded__method:{% endif %}



```C#
	private static void EntitiesLoaded<T>(IAsyncResult result, Collection<T> entities)
	{
	    DataServiceQuery<T> query = result.AsyncState as DataServiceQuery<T>;
	    foreach (T entity in query.EndExecute(result))
	    {
	        entities.Add(entity);
	    }
	}
```
```VB.NET
	Private Shared Sub EntitiesLoaded(Of T)(ByVal result As IAsyncResult, ByVal entities As Collection(Of T))
	    Dim query As DataServiceQuery(Of T) = TryCast(result.AsyncState, DataServiceQuery(Of T))
	    For Each entity As T In query.EndExecute(result)
	        entities.Add(entity)
	    Next entity
	End Sub
```

* Declare the __NorthwindDataSource__ object as a resource in your application. 



```XAML
	<UserControl.Resources>
	    <my:NorthwindDataSource x:Key="DataSource"/>
	</UserControl.Resources>
```

* Update your __RadGridView__ declaration - set the __ItemsSource__ property. 



```XAML
	<telerik:RadGridView ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource DataSource}, Path=Customers}"/>
```
