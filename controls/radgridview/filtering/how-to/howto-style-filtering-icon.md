# Style the Filtering Funnel Icon

In order to style the filtering funnel icon, you should predefine the template of the __FilteringDropDown__ element and change it as you would like. You can find more information on the topic in the [Styling FilteringControl and FilteringDropDown]({%slug gridview-styling-filteringcontrol%}) article.

To change the background color for the filtering icon, you should modify the brush named **GridView_FilterIconBackground_Filtered**, which paints the background of this element when a filter has been applied.
