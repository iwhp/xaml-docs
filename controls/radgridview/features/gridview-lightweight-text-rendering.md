# Lightweight Text Rendering

The `RadGridView` control provides the functionality to use a lightweight rendering mode for the cells' text, which boosts the performance. To enable this functionality, set the `EnableLightweightTextRendering` property of `RadGridView` to `true`. This alternative rendering will skip the creation of `TextBlock` elements that are used to display the cells' text. Instead, it will use a faster drawing API, which draws the cells in a separate panel.

#### __[WPF] Enabling the lightweight rendering mode__
{{region gridview-lightweight-text-rendering-0}}
    <telerik:RadGridView EnableLightweightTextRendering="True"
                         GroupRenderMode="Flat"/>
{{endregion}}

## Redraw Actions

The panel that is used for the lightweight rendering mode, will be forced to redraw when the following `GridViewCell` element's properties are changed:

* `FontSize`
* `FontFamily`
* `FontStyle`
* `FontWeight`
* `FontStretch`
* `HorizontalContentAlignment`
* `VerticalContentAlignment`

## Known Limitations

The lightweight text rendering is more performant, but it comes at the cost of some feature limitations. The following list shows some of the known features that are unsupported with the mode.

* Merged cells are not supported with this rendering mode. If the merged cells functionality is enabled, a `NotSupportedException` will be raised.
* Frozen columns are not supported with this rendering mode. Set the `CanUserFreezeColumns` property of RadGridView to __False__, in order to use the text rendering mode. Otherwise, a `NotSupportedException` will be raised.
* The `Nested` option of the `GroupRenderMode` property does not support this rendering mode. Set the group render mode to `Flat` to use the text rendering mode. Otherwise, a `NotSupportedException` will be raised.
* The `ShowTooltipOnTrimmedText` property of the columns does not support this rendering mode, as it relies on the `TextBlock` element of each the cell.
* The `CellTemplate` or `CellTemplateSelector` properties of the columns will disable this rendering mode for their cells.
* The `ContentTemplate` or `ContentTemplateSelector` properties of the `GridViewCell` element will disable this rendering mode.
* The `RightToLeft` option the `FlowDirection` property will disable this rendering mode.
