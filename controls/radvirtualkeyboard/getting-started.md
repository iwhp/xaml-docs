# Getting Started with {{ site.framework_name }} VirtualKeyboard

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a sample application that contains a VirtualKeyboard control.

## Adding Telerik Assemblies Using NuGet

To use `RadVirtualKeyboard` when working with NuGet packages, install the `Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation.for.Wpf.Xaml` package. The [package name may vary]({%slug nuget-available-packages%}) slightly based on the Telerik dlls set - [Xaml or NoXaml]({%slug xaml-vs-noxaml%})

Read more about NuGet installation in the [Installing UI for WPF from NuGet Package]({%slug nuget-installation%}) article.

>tip With the 2025 Q1 release, the Telerik UI for WPF has a new licensing mechanism. You can learn more about it [here]({%slug installing-license-key%}).

## Adding Assembly References Manually

If you are not using NuGet packages, you can add a reference to the following assemblies:

* __Telerik.Licensing.Runtime__
* __Telerik.Windows.Controls__
* __Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation__

## Defining the RadVirtualKeyboard

__Defining RadVirtualKeyboard in XAML__
```XAML
	 <telerik:RadVirtualKeyboard />
```

There is no need to manually subscribe an input element to the keyboard control. When you click a key on the VirtualKeyboard, a key press message is send to the OS. In addition to this, the control is unfocusable which means that if you focus a text input (like `TextBox` for example), the focus will stay there while you press the keys.
