# No Initial Animation

Some developers want to play different animation or no animation the first time Content is set. This may due to loading remote data or just a matter of graphic, animation or interaction design. You could easily achieve that by setting different transition on interrupted or completed. For example you could set the initial duration of a transition to be 0:0:0 like this in XAML:

#### __XAML__

```XAML
	<telerik:RadTransitionControl x:Name="TransitionControl"
	Duration="0:0:0" 		
	TransitionStatusChanged="RadTransitionControl_TransitionStatusChanged">
	    ...
	</telerik:RadTransitionControl>
```

And then in code behind set the duration to a reasonable time span after the first content appears:

#### __C#__

```C#
	private void RadTransitionControl_TransitionStatusChanged(object sender, TransitionStatusChangedEventArgs e)
	{
	    if (e.Status == TransitionStatus.Completed)
	    {
	        this.TransitionControl.Duration = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 1);
	    }
	}
```
