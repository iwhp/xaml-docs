# Telerik UI for WPF Prompt Library

The prompts provided here are intended and optimized for use with the Telerik UI for WPF AI Coding Assistant [MCP Server]({%slug ai-mcp-server%}). They can help you kick start your app development and speed up the component configuration process.

This collection of prompts is not exhaustive and the Telerik UI for WPF team is constantly working on adding more prompts to the library.

## How to Use the Prompts

All prompts in this library target the [MCP Server]({%slug ai-mcp-server%}) via the `#telerikwpf` handle. Make sure that you have installed and enabled the MCP Server before attempting to run the prompts.

1. Browse the prompt library to find a prompt that suits your needs.
2. Copy the prompt text (including the `#telerikwpf` handle).
3. (Optional) Customize the prompt as needed for your specific use case but keep the `#telerikwpf` handle.<br/>When modifying the prompts, make sure the changes comply with the [recommendations]({%slug ai-overview%}#recommendations) for the AI Coding Assistant.
4. Run the prompt against the [MCP Server]({%slug ai-mcp-server%}).

>Always double-check the code and solutions proposed by any AI-powered tool before applying them to your project.

>Use with the Copilot Extension

To run the provided prompts in the Telerik UI for WPF GitHub Copilot Extension (without the MCP Server installed), modify the prompts to use the `@telerikwpf` handle instead.
