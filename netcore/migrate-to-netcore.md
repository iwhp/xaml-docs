# Migrating to .NET

This article shows how to migrate from an existing WPF .NET Framework project to a .NET one (.{{ site.minimum_net_core_version }} or later).

1. Create a new __.NET__ application using Visual Studio.

	>tip You can also use the Telerik Visual Studio Extensions to create a new project. Read more about this in the [Integration]({%slug radcontrols-for-wpf-vs-extensions-project-creation%}) section of the documentation.
	
2. Add the existing files from the original project as linked files to the .NET project.

3. Reference the Telerik assemblies built against .NET.
	
	If Telerik UI for WPF is installed on the machine, you can find the dlls in the "*UI for WPF installation folder\Binaries\NET+version number*" folder. Otherwise, [download the .zip file]({%slug installation-installing-from-zip-wpf%}) with the dlls or install them via the [NuGet package manager]({%slug nuget-installation%}).

4. Several controls rely on third party NuGet packages. These are automatically installed when adding the Telerik assemblies via NuGet or the Telerik Visual Studio Extension. In case you reference the assemblies manually, one or more of the following packages should be installed manually: `System.Data.OleDb`, `System.Drawing.Common` and `System.ServiceModel.Http`.
