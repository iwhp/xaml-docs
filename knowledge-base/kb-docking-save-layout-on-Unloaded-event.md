## Description

How to save the layout of the RadDocking control when its unloaded.

## Solution

1. Add a new event handler for the `Unloaded` event of the `RadDocking` using the `EventManager.RegisterClassHandler` static method.

    __Add a new event handler for the Unloaded event of RadDocking__
    ```C#
        EventManager.RegisterClassHandler(typeof(RadDocking), RadDocking.   UnloadedEvent, new RoutedEventHandler(OnUnloaded));
    ```
```VB.NET
        EventManager.RegisterClassHandler(GetType(RadDocking), RadDocking.  UnloadedEvent, New RoutedEventHandler(OnUnloaded))
    ```

2. Implement the save logic in the newly added event handler for the `Unloaded` event.

    __Sample implementation of saving the layout in the newly added   handler__
    ```C#
        private void OnUnloaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            using (IsolatedStorageFile storage = IsolatedStorageFile.   GetUserStoreForAssembly())
            {
                using (var isoStream = storage.OpenFile("RadDocking_Layout.xml",    FileMode.Create))
                {
                    this.radDocking.SaveLayout(isoStream);
                }
            }
        }
    ```
```VB.NET
        Private Sub OnUnloaded(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As RoutedEventArgs)
            Using storage As IsolatedStorageFile = IsolatedStorageFile. GetUserStoreForAssembly()
                Using isoStream = storage.OpenFile("RadDocking_Layout.xml",     FileMode.Create)
                    Me.radDocking.SaveLayout(isoStream)
                End Using
            End Using
        End Sub
    ```
