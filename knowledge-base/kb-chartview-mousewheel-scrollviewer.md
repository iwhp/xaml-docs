## Description

Prevent the parent `ScrollViewer` element from scrolling when using the zoom functionality of RadCartesianChart.

## Solution

Subscribe to the `MouseWheel` event of the `RadCartesianChart` instance. In the event handler, set the `e.Handled` property to __True__.

>important Do not handle the `PreviewMouseWheel` event as it will disable the zoom functionality of the control.

__Subscribing to the MouseWheel event and setting the e.Handled property to True__
```C#
    private void RadCartesianChart_MouseWheel(object sender, MouseWheelEventArgs e)
    {
        e.Handled = true;
    }
```
