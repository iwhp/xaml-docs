## Description

`InvalidOperationException` is thrown when `RadDocking` is hosted in a window that can be opened on separate UI threads. 

The exception message is: *"The calling thread cannot access this object because a different thread owns it."*

## Solution

This happens because of a `MouseBinding` defined in the `InputBindings` collection of one of the `RadDocking` visuals (the `PaneHeader` element).

To avoid the issue, you can add a new `Style` for the `PaneHeader` element in the Resources of the window that opens on the new UI thread.


```XAML
	<UserControl.Resources>
		<!--If you use NoXaml dlls please add BasedOn="{StaticResource PaneHeaderStyle}" to the Style object. For example: -->
		<!--<Style TargetType="telerik:PaneHeader" BasedOn="{StaticResource PaneHeaderStyle}" >-->
		<Style TargetType="telerik:PaneHeader">
			<Setter Property="telerik:InputBindingsManager.InputBindings">
				<Setter.Value>
					<InputBindingCollection>
						<MouseBinding Command="telerikDocking:RadDockingCommands.PaneHeaderMenuOpen">
							<MouseBinding.Gesture>
								<MouseGesture MouseAction="RightClick" />
							</MouseBinding.Gesture>
						</MouseBinding>
					</InputBindingCollection>
				</Setter.Value>
			</Setter>
		</Style>
	</UserControl.Resources>
```

In some cases, you may need to merge this `Style` in the `Resources` of the opened `ToolWindow`. To do this, you can use the `ToolWindowCreated` event of `RadDocking`, where you can access the `Resources` of the window in code-behind.
