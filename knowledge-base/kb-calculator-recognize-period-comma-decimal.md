## Description

When using the RadCalculatorPicker on a device without a numeric keypad, the decimal key does not work as expected. This article demonstrates how to make RadCalculatorPicker recognize the period or comma key as a decimal separator. 

## Solution

To make RadCalculatorPicker recognize the period (.) or comma (,) key as the decimal separator, subscribe to the `KeyDown` event and execute the `RadCalculatorCommands.UpdateInput` command.


```C#
	private void RadCalculatorPicker_KeyDown(object sender, System.Windows.Input.KeyEventArgs e)
	{
		if (e.Key == System.Windows.Input.Key.OemPeriod)
		{
			RadCalculatorCommands.UpdateInput.Execute(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.NumberFormat.NumberDecimalSeparator);
		}
	}
```
