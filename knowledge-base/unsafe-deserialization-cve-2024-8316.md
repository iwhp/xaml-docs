  - Via deployed application: Locate any `Telerik.Windows.*.dll` file in the application's directory, right-click, select Properties and view the Version in the Details tab.
- If you have any questions or concerns related to this issue, open a new Technical Support case in [Your Account | Support Center](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center/contact-us/). Technical Support is available to Telerik customers with an active support plan.
